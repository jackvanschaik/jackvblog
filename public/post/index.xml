      <description>library(tidyverse)library(corrplot)IntroductionThe following analysis shows a strong relationship between eviction in Indiana, African American population rate, and COVID infection rates. These populations are at an increased risk of a faster COVID-19 infection rate in Indiana.
This analysis is completely reproducible. The R code to gather the data, prep it, and perform the analysis are on my Github.
Data ExtractWe’ll extract data from two places:</description>

      <description>Indiana Coronavirus Case ModelI’ve been working on a statistical model for predicting daily COVID-19 case counts in Indiana.
I gathered data from 7 places:
https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirushttps://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htmhttps://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=UShttps://evictionlab.org/https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csvhttps://www.wfyi.org/https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/I also manually included the “phases” for Holcomb’s Back on Track plan.
ResultsMy model is still in development, but I’ve made some progress. I set aside the last 28 days as testing data and trained my model on the remaining data.</description>

      <description>Why Bother?If you work with diagnosis data, you’re likely to encounter ICD codes. ICD (Internal Classification of Diseases) is a globally used set codes that hierarchically classifies diagnoses, symptoms, and other clinical observations. Since the adoption of the Electronic Health Records (EHR), the primary revision of ICD in use ICD-9. At least, that was so until October 1st, 2015, when the United States made a nationwide switch to ICD-10.</description>

      <description>IntroductionHealth Information Exchanges (HIEs) allow for the transfer and storage of EHR data across institutions, with the primary use of improving patient care (Health IT 2020). The combination of multiple EHRs creates a wealth of data that can also be attractive for secondary uses such as research. Recent advances in machine learning and data science have enabled the analysis of HIE data in unanticipated ways.</description>

      <title>How To: Create a Practice OMOP Dataset in R</title>

      <description>IntroductionThe use of electronic health record (EHR) data is common and often necessary in clinical research. These data can be cumbersome and complicated, yet inaccessible due to privacy laws. My goal in this post is to set the reader up with a “fake” clinical dataset so that they can learn the ins and out of EHR data and feel more prepared when they encounter the real thing.</description>
