<p>Today I’ve made for you an interactive table, using four ingredients:</p>

<li>Rmarkdown</li>
<li>The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">datatable</a> package</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools">jsonlite</a> package</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jeffreybraun/chopped-10-years-of-episode-data">Chopped dataset</a> from Kaggle.</li>

<p>With a sprinkle of javascript, the data table is made interactive and a lot easier to digest.</p>
