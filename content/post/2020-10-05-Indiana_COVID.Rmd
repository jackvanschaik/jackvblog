## Indiana Coronavirus Case Model

I've been working on a statistical model for predicting daily COVID-19 case counts in Indiana.

I gathered data from 7 places:

* [https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus](The R coronavirus package)
* [https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htm](Indiana State Department of Health)
* [https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US](Google Trends)
* [https://evictionlab.org/](Eviction Lab)
* [https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv](Google Mobility data)
* [https://www.wfyi.org/](WFYI news)
* [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/](Rural Urban Commuting Codes)

I also manually included the "phases" for Holcomb's Back on Track plan.

## Results

My model is still in development, but I've made some progress. I set aside the last 28 days as testing data and trained my model on the remaining data.

After some tweaking, here are two iterations that were fairly successful:

#### Version 1

This version of the model has testing $R^2$ of about 0.714. It significantly underpredicts cases in the most recent week, however.

#### Version 2

This next version of the model has a lower testing $R^2$ of 0.634, however it is simpler than the above model, more interpretable, and captures the overall trend pretty well.

## Discussion

While these results are preliminary and the model is not yet very sophisticated, I have been able to make some inferences:

* Day of week is needed to account for weekly periodicity
* Google searches for "Indiana Coronavirus" are somewhat predictive of COVID-19 cases
* Mobility, both on the county and state level, are predictive of COVID-19 cases

I'll go into more detail later. I also hope to do daily forecasting.
