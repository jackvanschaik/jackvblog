## Indiana Coronavirus Case Model

I've been working on a statistical model for predicting daily COVID-19 case counts in Indiana.

I gathered data from 7 places:

* [https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus](The R coronavirus package)
* [https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htm](Indiana State Department of Health)
* [https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US](Google Trends)
* [https://evictionlab.org/](Eviction Lab)
* [https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv](Google Mobility data)
* [https://www.wfyi.org/](WFYI news)
* [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/](Rural Urban Commuting Codes)

I also manually included the "phases" for Holcomb's Back on Track plan.

## Results

My model is still in development, but I've made some progress. Set aside the last 28 days as testing data and trained my model on the remaining data.

After some tweaking, here are two iterations that were fairly successful:
