<h2>Indiana Coronavirus Case Model</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on a statistical model for predicting daily COVID-19 case counts in Indiana.</p>
<p>I gathered data from 7 places:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="The%20R%20coronavirus%20package">https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus</a></li>
<li><a href="Indiana%20State%20Department%20of%20Health">https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htm</a></li>
<li><a href="Google%20Trends">https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US</a></li>
<li><a href="Eviction%20Lab">https://evictionlab.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="Google%20Mobility%20data">https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="WFYI%20news">https://www.wfyi.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="Rural%20Urban%20Commuting%20Codes">https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also manually included the “phases” for Holcomb’s Back on Track plan.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>My model is still in development, but I’ve made some progress. I set aside the last 28 days as testing data and trained my model on the remaining data.</p>
<p>After some tweaking, here are two iterations that were fairly successful:</p>
<div id="version-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Version 1</h4>
<p>This version of the model has testing <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of about 0.714. It significantly underpredicts cases in the most recent week, however.</p>

</div>
<div id="version-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Version 2</h4>
<p>This next version of the model has a lower testing <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of 0.634, however it is simpler than the above model, more interpretable, and captures the overall trend pretty well.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>While these results are preliminary and the model is not yet very sophisticated, I have been able to make some inferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day of week is needed to account for weekly periodicity</li>
<li>Google searches for “Indiana Coronavirus” are somewhat predictive of COVID-19 cases</li>
<li>Mobility, both on the county and state level, are predictive of COVID-19 cases</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll go into more detail later. I also hope to do daily forecasting.</p>
