<h2>About</h2>
<p>I created the following dataset for some coursework. It combines social determinants from the Census and COVID-19 outcomes from the Indiana government.
The data is small, clean, normalized, and ready for analysis. You can run the code yourself or just copy the table at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Each row in the dataset represents one county in Indiana, as indicated by the “location_id” and “county_name” columns. Note that column name prefixes indicate if the variable is an outcome or predictor. There are several outcome variables. All outcome variables have been normalized to count per 100k residents in the county. There are outcome variables for total cases and deaths during the entire span of the pandemic as well as three different “waves”. These waves correspond to Indiana’s back on track plan put in place by the state government, and it may be interesting to consider these seperately.</p>
