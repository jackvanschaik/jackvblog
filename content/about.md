Hello! I'm Jack VanSchaik. I am a Data Science PhD Student at [IUPUI](https://soic.iupui.edu/), IU's Indianapolis campus.

Some of my research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Ethics. In particular, I am interested in developing tools for organizing and understanding large amounts of text data. Applications to healthcare and medecine are particularly interesting. The [NLP work](https://jackvanschaik.github.io/pain_gene_nlp/) Iâ€™m doing with [my advisor](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/) aims to discover relationships between genes in academic articles about pain. 

In my undergrad, I studied Math and Statistics at Purdue and worked at [The Center For Global Soundscapes](https://centerforglobalsoundscapes.org/). After graduating, I worked as a Data Analyst at [The Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/.

Here are some things I've done:

* To facilitate the quick use of ACS data, I created the [QUACS](https://github.com/regenstrief/quacs) R package at Regenstrief. I presented about this at [AMIA](https://knowledge.amia.org/71623-amia-1.4589302/t0005-1.4590480/t0005-1.4590481/a155-1.4590833/an155-1.4590834?qr=1).

* I was the lead Data Analyst for the [Indiana Addictions Data Commons](https://www.regenstrief.org/article/iadc-dashboard-data-day/) at Regenstrief. It was a privilege to help researchers fight the opioid epidemic with data. 

* In my role as lead data analyst for the IU/Regenstrief branch of the [Greater Plains Collaborative](https://gpcnetwork.org/), helped contribute clinical data to large, cross institutional research projects. 

* I started as a Data Analyst I at Regenstrief and was promoted within a year to Data Analyst II. I was the Data Core's 2019 employee of the year. 

* I worked on pure math research during my final year at Purdue. It was about a family of real value functions related to the Riemann Hypothesis. I presented my results at the [Rose Hulman Undergraduate Math Conference](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/ma/web/mathconf/2018/images/UGMC2018Program.pdf). I was awarded a summer research fellowship to do this work. 

* I did soundscape research was the [cover article of JPUR](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jpur/vol7/iss1/10/) my junior year.

* During undergrad, I helped PhD students with the stats on their papers. I was coauthored on [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574954118301900) and [another one](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4988940)
