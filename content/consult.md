I am open to work consulting, collaborating, or tutoring. Here's what I have to offer:

### Data Experience

Wrangling data typically takes much more work than analyzing it. I've worked extensively with big, messy data and can make the most difficult datasets research ready.

* Imputation. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2021/01/03/kaggle-a-low-usability-dataset/)
* Web Scraping. [Example 1](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/10/29/wfyi-web-scraper/), [Example 2](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/12/29/on-the-fly-web-page-ingestion-with-plumber/)
* Big Audio Data. [Example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QRLfYWAdlGzJ-breAPyzNtZPCA87MyljrUQs4QPbuV4/edit?usp=sharing)
* Clinical Data. This stuff gets _messy_.  Extensive clinical data work at Regenstrief. 
* Text Data: Wrangling, cleaning, tokenzing, parseing, etc. Current research as well as work at [Regenstrief](https://www.regenstrief.org/implementation/ndepth/).
* Relational Data: Extensive work at Regenstrief. 


### Analytical Methods

After I've wrangled data into ship-shape, I can analyze it too. My theoretical Math/Stats background, years of applied experience, and programming skills make me a Jack of all trades when it comes to methods. 

Here are just a few examples that come to mind:

* Linear Models. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/10/09/analysis-indiana-covid-19-infection-rate-disparities/)
* Spatial Statistics. [Example](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jpur/vol7/iss1/10/)
* Bayesian Data Analysis. [Example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QRLfYWAdlGzJ-breAPyzNtZPCA87MyljrUQs4QPbuV4/edit?usp=sharing).
* Classification. [Example 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574954118301900), [Example 2](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/12/30/kaggle-credit-card-customers/)
* Time Series. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/10/05/indiana-covid-19-case-model/)
* Frequentist stats. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/11/06/analysis-stop-the-steal-hashtag/)
* Natural Language Processing. Ongoing research work. word2vec, BERT, etc.
* Deep Learning. 

### Programming and Coding

I've been programming for a while. I first taught myself Visual Basic for a 7th grade science fair project and remember learning Python when the community was awaiting the release 3.0. As a rapscallion hacker in high school, I learned Javascript & HTML, PHP, SQL, Java, some strokes of C++ and even a little assembly. Moving to undergrad, I decided to use my powers for good. I wrote my first line of R in a Big Data Analysis course and have used it almost every day since. As a data science PhD student, R and Python are the tools I used day to day. Javascript holds a very special place in my heart and keep C++ in the holster for when I need a little speed boost.

* R. See next section.
* Python. Used for current research and coursework.
* Javascript. [Example 1](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/10/28/neatly-embedding-r-data-frames-via-javascript/), [Example 2](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/09/28/dtdatatable-seasoned-with-javascript/)
* SQL. Specifically used Oracle SQL and MSSQL at Regenstrief. Also experienced with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. 
* SAS. Used extensively at Regenstrief.
* Linux/Unix command line, job management on research computing, SSH, SFTP, and whatnot

### R Programming

I've been using R extensively for many years. I used it for courses and research in undergrad. I used R daily at Regenstrief and continue to use it daily for my research work today. I have a lot of experience with many different packages and use cases. This list has a few highlights, but really just scratches the surface.

* Rcpp. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2021/01/06/logistic-map-with-rcpp/)
* tidyverse. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/09/29/tidy-tuesday-9-29-2020/)
* ggplot2. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2021/01/04/tidy-tuesday-01-04-2021-transit-cost/)
* plumber. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/12/29/on-the-fly-web-page-ingestion-with-plumber/)
* shiny. [Example](https://github.com/regenstrief/quacs)
* Rmarkdown. [Examples](https://web.jackv.xyz/)
* blogdown. [Example: You're looking at it](https://web.jackv.xyz/)
* rvest. [Example](https://web.jackv.xyz/2020/10/29/wfyi-web-scraper/)
* Package development [Example](https://github.com/regenstrief/quacs)
* Database Connection via R. 
* sparklyr. 

Here's a [video of me working on an R package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUSjdVMSwGk).

### Tools and Frameworks

I'm sure I'm missing a lot here. 

* Amazon AWS. This website is running on EC2 free tier.
* Ubuntu Server.
* REDCap. Via Regenstrief. 
* Cerner and EPIC clarity extensively at Regenstrief. EPIC Certified.
* OMOP and PCORNET common data models.
* Rstudio server. 

### Coursework

Here are examples of courses I've taken. There's a mix of undergrad/graduate here:

* Probability Theory, Statistical Theory, Statistics
* Bayesian Data Analysis
* Linear Models, Time Series Analysis
* Data Analysis, Big Data Analysis
* Python Programming, Java Programming, SAS Programming
* Calculus, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations
* Real Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Complex Analysis
* Linear Algebra, Algebra
* Information Policy

### Other

* Have worked under IRB's for clinical projects, and worked in HIPAA compliant computation environments
